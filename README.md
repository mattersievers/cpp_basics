  ## Description
  These are some basic C++ functions. Further description is provided via comment in the individual C++ (.cpp) files themselves.

  ## Install
  After downloading and unzipping the files, to run the (.exe) application files, access them through a command prompt. Call the directory you have placed the files in with `cd file location`. To navigate to the single file functions folder, use `cd single file functions` and call the program by name such as `hello` or `tenth_power`. To run C++, you will need a compiler. My preferred method is using VSCode with the C++ extension and GCC compiler. Download instructions may be found [clicking here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw).
  
  ## Use
  After invoking the application follow the prompts provided.
